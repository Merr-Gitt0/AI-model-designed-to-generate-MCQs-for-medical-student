# AI-Powered Multiple-Choice Question Generator for Medical Students

## Overview
This project focuses on developing an innovative AI model specifically designed to generate multiple-choice questions tailored to medical students. This AI-powered solution aims to enhance exam preparation by providing challenging yet instructive questions across various modules within the medical curriculum.

## Training Approach
The AI model undergoes training using a specialized dataset comprising tuples that link individual courses within specific modules to their corresponding sets of multiple-choice questions. Through this training process, the model discerns intricate patterns within each course, enabling it to construct questions and craft answer choices that are non-trivial. The goal is to offer students a valuable resource for honing their skills across different question formats.

## Data Sources
Our project leverages various data sources to construct a robust and diverse database for training the AI model. These sources include:

- Specialized datasets linking courses to multiple-choice questions
- Medical curriculum materials covering various modules
- Expertly curated question banks from medical education resources
  
## Empowering Medical Students
Our AI-powered multiple-choice question generator is designed to empower medical students in their exam preparation journey. By offering a range of challenging questions with non-obvious correct answers, our solution enhances critical thinking and deepens understanding across different areas of study within the medical field.
